# Style Guide

- We will go with a clean and modern design, this portfolio design is inspired by someone on dribbble.com.

- Here I have chosen a space theme, you can get creative with it, go for somthing else later, that shows your personal interests so that your portfolio feels personal and interesting.

**Please check out the Designs folder, to take a look at the final results.**

### File Organisation

Every section of our html+css website is going to have a seperate CSS file, to make styling more organised and easily accessible. All of the style files will be then imported into a single file called index.js and then linked to our HTML document.

### Colors

```
:root {
  --night-black: #1c0c1c;
  --pitch-black: #180c14;
  --primary-color: #612dbc;
  --secondary-color: #66456a;
}
```

### Fonts

```
font-family: "Lucida Sans", "Lucida Sans Regular", "Lucida Grande";
```

### Layout

For the layout and responsive design of the site, we are going to use CSS Flexbox.
