![Design preview for the Personal Portfolio Landing Page ](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Introduction

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for taking part in this HTML+CSS Workshop. This project will help you enhance your HTML and CSS skills by building a personal portfolio landing page. I'll guide you through this challenge, but read up content below, as if it is a challenge you have to work out on your own!

**By the end of this workshop you should be equipped with HTML+CSS, to build something from scratch, on your own**

## The Challenge

Your task is to build a personal portfolio landing page that closely matches the provided design.

Your users should be able to:

- View the landing page in an optimal layout based on their device's screen size, such as desktop, Tablets, mobile
- Observe hover states for interactive elements
- Navigate through testimonials using a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message if the Contact me form is submitted and:
  - The input field is empty
  - The email address is incorrectly formatted

If you need any support or have questions during the challenge, feel free to ask me for assistance, or discuss it with your peers, after all it has to be interactive, else it is a yet another online course, you're tired of repeating 10 secs back ;).

## Project Assets

In the `/design` folder, you will find the design files for both mobile and desktop versions of the landing page. Please refer to these designs as you work on the project.

The designs are in static JPG format, so you'll need to use your judgment for styles like `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin`.

The `/images` folder contains all the necessary assets, which are already optimized for use in the project.

**Note** : We will refer to the `style-guide.md` file for essential information, such as the color palette and fonts to be used.

## Building Your Project

Here's a suggested process, but you're not obligated to follow it:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Having a repository will make it easier to share your code with others if you need assistance. If you're not familiar with creating a repository, you can refer to the [Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will enable you to share the URL of your project with others if you require help. There are various ways to achieve this, and we recommend some options below.
3. Carefully examine the designs to plan how you'll approach the project. This step is crucial for thinking ahead and creating reusable CSS classes.
4. Start by structuring your content using HTML. Writing your HTML first will help ensure your content is well-organized.
5. Develop the base styles for your project, including general content styles such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Begin styling from the top of the page and work your way down. Make sure to complete each section before moving on to the next.

## Deploying Your Project

As mentioned earlier, there are several free options available for hosting your project. Here are our recommended hosts:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

You can choose any of these solutions or select another trusted provider. For further information, you can read about our [recommended and trusted hosts](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe).
